# Pull Request Reviews

I personally agree with many of the ideas presented at
[conventionalcomments.org](https://conventionalcomments.org). I'll summarize the
ideas that resonated most with me below:

1. Prefixing comments with a label: I believe this clarifies your intent and
   personalizes the comment a bit more

   **suggestion** : This is not worded correctly.

2) Actionable comments: In the case of suggestions, I see great value in giving
   an action item/idea that prompts a discussion.

   **suggestion** : This is not worded correctly.

   _Can we change this to match the wording of the marketing page?_

> Note that the above examples were not my own!
